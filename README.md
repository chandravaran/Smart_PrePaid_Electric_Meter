# Smart_PrePaid_Electric_Meter
We Designed and created a smart electric meter, which is connected to the user through gsm, we have designed our own voltage and current sensor the whole setup is simulated on proteus 

## Steps to use the project

1) The first step invloves you to complie the arduino code in arduino ide and then upload the hex files into the arduino they have been labeled as bottom and top for easy understanding.

2) The gsm modules hex file also has to be uploaded onto it.

3) The same thing have to be done for both circuits.
