sir these are the instructions if you want to simulate 
1) first you need to complie the arduino code in arduino ide and then upload the hex files into the arduino they
have been labeled as bottom and top for easy understanding.
2)the gsm modules hex file also has to be uploaded onto it.
3)the same thing has to be done for both circuits.
